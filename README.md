# Pornstar Social Media Finder (Firefox Add-on)
A little Firefox Add-on which helps you find all the social media accounts of a porn star, by adding a new search option to the (right click) context menu.

### How does this Firefox Add-on work?
Whenever you are browsing the web, doesn't matter which website, could be Youtube, Reddit, you name it... As soon as you stumble upon a hot adult model online which you would like to follow on any of the social media platforms out there, simply select (highlight) that model's name with your mouse, click the right mouse button and select the "Find pornstar on social media" option.

This will spawn the browser to open the socialmediapornstars.com search page in a new browser tab, using that model's name (you've highlighted) as the search query that's used. If there is an exact match in our database, you will be redirected to the page showing all of that porn star's social media usernames directly.
If your search query receives multiple matching results, the search page will return all matching models in the (blockchain) database at socialmediapornstars.com.

Besides the quick search function using your right mouse button, there's also a browser popup screen will let's you easily search through all model's (this part is hosted server side and is simply an embedded page through an iframe).
